# SWAPI Takehome

This is intended to be a short takehome exercise where you integrate with a third party API to create a simple React application. Fork or download this repository to complete the challenge. Please do not submit pull requests to this repository as a solution.

(Alternatively, if you would like to accomplish this same task in a different environment, you are welcome to. We provide this as a template, not as a requirement.)

## Getting Started

First, install packages

```bash
yarn
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Code Challenge

Using the [SWAPI 3rd party API](https://swapi.dev/), your task is to display the name, eye color, and homeworld of people that have brown in their hair. How you choose to display the data is completely up to your interpretation. (There is some code already written in `app/page.tsx` to get you started.)

You should only spend ONE HOUR on this takehome. Depending on your level of experience with the frameworks and language, this will mean that you might not be able to even finish the task! That is totally normal, and the completion of the task is not something that you will be evaluated on. If you need to spend a little more time to complete something, we cannot enforce a hard cut-off, but please don't feel pressure to complete more than 1 hour of time.

If you find yourself running out of time, use the rest of the time to write down your thought processes in what you would have done next had you been given more time. 

If you find yourself complete with the task and with additional time to spare, use the rest of the time add whatever additional features you think would be useful to someone using the application.

You are allowed to use whatever tools you see necessary to solve the problem, including LLMs (like ChatGPT) but be prudent about the usage as this is meant to test your skill, and know that in a future interview you may be asked to justify and even add or modify whatever code you write. And therefore should not rely on an LLM to write code for you without truly interanalizing what is being written.

If there is a piece of code that you want to add to increase the amount of things you are able to accomplish during the timespan (such as if you are not a CSS wizard and want to add some cool CSS) then feel free to add it and mark that section or add a comment indicating that it was done with the assistance of an LLM with the intent to add something that you otherwise would not have had time or knowledge to do yourself given the constraints of the exercise. 

## Additional tasks to consider

We'll evaluate submissions on the following criteria:

1. Does the code run?
2. Are the instructions in the README clear? (Especially relevant if you decided to use a different environment)
3. Is the code easy to understand?
4. Did you implement the features you decided to tackle, or did you at least explain how you would have accomplished the feature if you had been given more time?

## Instructions for Submission

Please email [1kin-eng@1kin.io](mailto:1kin-eng@1kin.io) and [dnorth@1kin.io](mailto:dnorth@1kin.io) a .zip or link to a source code repository containing your code. Include a `README.md` file with notes on how to run your code, your thoughts on how you prioritized your work and your thought processes on tackling the problem, and anything else you think is relevant to help understand your mindset in problem-solving.

Please email us if anything in the instructions needs additional clarification. The task is meant to be small but also leave space for creativity. We don't want you to be stuck or frustrated if something is unclear.

May the force be with you! (Sorry, had to throw that one in there...)
